I am an experienced undergraduate researcher with a demonstrated history of working in the domain of blockchain applications and decentralized finance (DeFi). I completed my undergrad at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, during which time I worked extensively with [Dr. Vikas Hassija](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x4RT1ukAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Dr. Vinay Chamola](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/vinaychamola/profile), and [Dr. Salil Kanhere](https://salilkanhere.net/). I have also worked as a mentor at [IoT lab](https://bitsiotlab.com/), BITS Pilani (2020-2021), where not only did I attain valuable mentorship experience, but I also got a chance to work with various reputed researchers across the globe. Besides blockchain, I have also dabbled in the field of machine learning, primarily deep learning models such as GRUs and LSTM and the federated learning technique. 

I have co-authored 6 publications in top-tier conferences and journals such as IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (IEEE T-ITS), IEEE Internet of Things Journal, ACM MobiHoc, among others. I am also an invited reviewer for IEEE T-ITS.

I am currently working as a DeFi/research analyst at [Dfyn.network](https://dfyn.network/) and [Router Protocol](https://routerprotocol.com/) to gain further experience in the realm of DeFi. Previously, I co-founded a PIEDS-funded health-tech startup, [Medsupervision](https://medsupervision.com/), that used modern technologies like OCR, blockchain, and others, to solve existing problems in the healthcare landscape. This startup stemmed from one of the projects that I had done as an undergraduate at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology. Had to shelve the project since obtaining distribution became exponentially hard as we iterated over initial feedback. I am really passionate about blockchain as a technology, and I think its potential implications are underplayed due to the stigma surrounding cryptocurrencies. 

Among extracurriculars, I enjoy playing football (soccer for my American friends), reading books, and debating. In school and early years of college, I actively participated in debating events such as MUNs and World Scholar's Cup (WSC). Although it's been a while since I was active in the debating circuit, I could still give you a run for your money.
