title: Data Mining For Spatio-Temporal Rules With Geospatial Analysis of Crime Patterns
description: This project establishes a framework based on clustering and association rule mining to detect and analyze trends from temporal and spatial crime activity data. In this model, an open-source GIS application, QGIS, has been used to reveal crime hotspots, and a time series analysis has also been performed to analyze the changing patterns of crime with time.

<h5>Problem Statement</h5>
Increased population, technological advancements and heightened competition for economic
resources have created various social problems. Many of these changes in the human condition
have brought new challenges to the doorstep of the law enforcement profession that begs for
resolution. The major challenge facing law enforcement agencies is to deal with the increased
number of criminal activities effectively and efficiently. Current policing strategies work towards finding the criminals, basically after the crime has occurred. However, with the help of
technological advancement, we can use historical crime data to recognise crime patterns.
If enforcement agencies have a prior assumption of the class of the crime, it would give them
tactical advantages and help resolve cases faster. An overall study of criminal activity in a
geographic area also helps in understanding the underlying pattern of the crime in that area

<h5>Project Objectives</h5>
The primary objective of this work is to analyse criminal data based on demographics, spatial and temporal information and consequently identify useful crime patterns to aid police
in preventing crimes. Towards this end, this project uses data mining and crime mapping
techniques. The main objectives of this project are summarised as follows:
<ol>
<li>Identifying the crime patterns based on a criminal dataset that contains the geographical
location and basic details of the criminal activity.</li>
<li>Exploring data mining techniques to generate association rules for crime analysis.</li>
<li>Visualising these patterns on an open source GIS software - QGIS for better understanding of the results.</li>
</ol>
